Description: The package is designed as an extension to the "CloudProvider"
    class in the "DockerParallel" package. It provides the kubernete-like 
    functions to manage cloud instance for the non-kubernete cloud.
    For creating a "CloudProvider" for the non-k8s cloud service, the developer
    needs to define the method for the generics "runDockerWorkerContainers",
    "getDockerWorkerStatus" and "killDockerWorkerContainers"
