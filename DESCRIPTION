Description: 
  The package is designed as an extension to the "CloudProvider"
  class in the "DockerParallel" package. It provides the kubernetes-like 
  functions to manage cloud instance for the non-kubernetes cloud.
  For creating a "CloudProvider" for the non-kubernetes cloud service, the developer
  needs to define the method for the generics "runDockerWorkerContainers",
  "getDockerWorkerStatus" and "killDockerWorkerContainers".
